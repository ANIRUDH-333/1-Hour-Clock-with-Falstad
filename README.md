# 1-Hour-Clock-with-Falstad
Generating a clock signal for driving a digital clock and demonstrating the working of the  digital clock. Building the design of a digital clock that ticks each second and goes up to 1  hour using the FF of your choice. It can be either an asynchronous or synchronous circuit.  Generate square waves using a transistor-based Schmitt trigger circuit and use it as the  clock signal.

# To access circuits

1. Go to Falstad and click on Open
2. Select the circuit which you want, either [main circuit](Circuits/Main%20Circuit) or [sub circuits](Circuits/Sub%20Circuits).
3. Open that txt file and the circuit will be loaded to falstad

Understand more about the circuits and their working by going through this [report](Elec_report.pdf)
